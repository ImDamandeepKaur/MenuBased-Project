# MenuBased-Project
🌟 Automated Menu-Driven Application
Welcome to the Automated Menu-Driven Application repository! This project was developed as part of my summer internship at LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd. The goal was to create a versatile, user-friendly application that integrates multiple technologies to automate a variety of tasks.

🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and automated solution for managing tasks related to cloud services, containerization, and scripting. The application is designed to simplify complex operations by offering a streamlined, menu-driven interface.

💻 Technologies Implemented
AWS: Automated cloud operations like IAM user creation, EC2 instance management, S3 bucket handling, and SNS services.
Docker: Implemented containerization to ensure consistent environments across different stages of deployment.
Python: Developed scripts for various functionalities such as sending SMS, fetching geo-coordinates, and more.
Frontend: Designed a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy navigation of the menu.
🌟 Project Highlights
AWS Automation: Simplified tasks such as "Create IAM User," "Launch Instance," "Get Instance Log," and "Manage S3 Bucket."
Docker Automation: Integrated Docker operations directly into the menu for efficient container management.
Python-Powered Tasks: Easily accessible functions like "SMS through Python," "Get Geo Coordinates," and "Send Email."
